= ~/.vim/

My settings for Vim. See comments in link:vimrc[] for list of supported
features (in Russian).

Since 2024-07 I'm using Neovim, so do not expect much updates in this repo.
My Neovim config: https://github.com/powerman/config.nvim.

== Install

Remove `~/.vimrc` and `~/.vim/`, then:

```
git clone https://github.com/powerman/dotvim ~/.vim
```

=== Plugin: deoplete
See https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim#requirements for details, but
usually it's enough to build vim with python3 support and run:

```
pip3 install --user pynvim
```

== Update from version installed before 2020-02-09

Before 2020-02-09 this repo has used git submodules. You'll need to use
this upgrade procedure to get rid of git submodules and switch to updating
this repo using simple `git pull`.

1. (optional) If you've your own changes then make sure they're committed
   to some branch (we'll use name "local" here). If you've added own
   submodules then you should backup them now - because they'll be REMOVED
   RIGHT NOW - and also have an idea how to re-add them after update
   without using submodules.
2. `git checkout master`
3. `git fetch`
4. If you'll try `git pull` now it'll fail, so run `git merge
   remove-submodules` instead to move forward as far as it is possible
   right now.
5. Now it's time to remove all submodules repos: `rm -rf .git/modules`
6. And then delete all untracked files from `bundle/` dir: `git clean -f bundle`
7. Finally, you can update to the latest version: `git pull`
8. (optional) If you've your own changes in the "local" branch, then it's
   time to make them accessible again: `git rebase master local`
